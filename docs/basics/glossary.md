### Keyset

A keyset has two components: a set of keys and  a predicate function that determines which keys are required to sign a transaction (do all keys need to be present? only one? two? etc.). Pact keysets allow you to specify authorization to different parts of the smart contract. They help determine which accounts have access to which parts of the programs you create.
